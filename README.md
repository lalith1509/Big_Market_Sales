# Big_Market_Sales
üåê Project Overview

This repository is dedicated to a comprehensive project focused on predicting sales for a retail dataset, utilizing machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of transactional and product-related details from various outlets. The objective is to develop a predictive model to estimate sales, enabling better inventory management and revenue forecasting.

üåü Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to analyze transactional data and develop a predictive model for sales forecasting. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the project aims to provide insights that assist retailers in optimizing sales strategies, improving stock management, and increasing revenue. The dataset undergoes data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering before training an advanced regression model for accurate predictions.

üéØ Project Objectives

The specific objectives of this project include:

Data Collection & Cleaning: Load and clean the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform data visualization and statistical analysis to identify key patterns and relationships.

Feature Engineering: Transform categorical variables, scale numerical features, and create new meaningful features to enhance model performance.

Data Preprocessing: Apply encoding techniques and handle missing data efficiently.

Model Training & Evaluation: Train and evaluate different regression models, including XGBoost, to predict sales with high accuracy.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters to improve predictive performance.
